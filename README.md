## 🌊 The tides (challenges) I sailed across this GSoC season 🌊
1. Decide how to develop the project wether to develop it as an npm module, or Git Submodule or independent repository.
2. Implement a secure role based access.
3. Dockerizing the Superprofile - FaunaDB.
4. Figuring out how to initialize the Open Event Server with some dummy data.
5. Exploring the huge codebase of Open Event Server to figure out how it works.

## 🔮 Challenges in the future bag 🔮
1. Improving the NextJS docker files.
2. Adding event email notification.
3. Improving the documentations.
4. Enhancing the Admin Dashboard.
5. Providing event stream analytics.

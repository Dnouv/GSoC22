## üöÄ More about RC4Conferences üòÆ
</div>
An open source scaled virtual conferences creation, management, and operation system. It aims to enable online communities to easily run and host virtual events of any size. Built over contemporary ReactJS components with full stack behaviors, powered by NextJS. This project leverages FOSS Asia's excellent open source Event-yay server backend for conference creation and management. For day of conference operations, this project leverage open source Jitsi video's broadcast capability to an RTMP-forest for scaled consumption while embedded Rocket.Chat enables attendees and speakers to mingle and collaborate freely ‚Äì with full persistent chat history.

## üì¶Deliverablesüì¶
  
</div>

- Event Authentication Component - Component which handles sign up and sign in with Open Event Server for the users, and stores the token recieved from the server in the cookies.
- Event Create Component - Component which helps to mutate the Open Event Server with Event Data, and Speakers data.
- Event Display Component - Component that diplays the events created based on the event id, and includes different tabs viz. About, Sessions, Speakers
- Event Admin Dashboard Component - A set of component which enables the event creator/admin to edit and delete events and event related data, currently only speakers details can be edited.
- Day of Event Components - A jitsi window component to catch the streams of Speakers, and broadcast them using RTMP to the second component which did the task of catching this stream and broadcast it to the Event attendees.

Some wonderful features suggested by Mentors:
- Integration with Superprofile for a better role based access to different user routes.
- Storing encrypted cookies instead of raw user data.
- Dockerizing almost all the backend and frontend services except for Strapi, for a smooth development environment setup.
- Setting up a docker user-defined network for internal communication between various containers.

## üìπ Some Feature Demo Clips üìπ
</div>

### Creating a Event
All the data recieved from the Event basic details form are used for mutating the Open Event Server with Event Details. This demo shows the Event Authorization component on the page, `/conferences/create` when the user clicks on the "Create Event", followed by the Event Create component once the user fills in all the details this component handles doing the mutation by interacting with Open Event Server and prompting a success event creation message.

### Admin Dashboard
A walkthrough of the options available on the Admin Dashboard. The Demo displays the Event Admin components, from where the Event owner is able to "Add Speaker", "Delete Speakers", "Delete Events", and "Preview Events".

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61188295/189500874-0a1298e0-e455-4a7e-9e08-ea456febe3b2.mp4


### Event Display Poster Page
Features available on the Event Poster page, with many different tabs viz. About, Sessions, and Speakers. The Demo displays the implemented Event Display Poster component, which handles fetching the event details and rendering it in a nice UI.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61188295/189488239-0aa31cf8-a8fe-42bf-95ab-65c9f03797b2.mp4


### Demo of Role based access to different day of event pages
As shown in demo a not signed in user won't be able to access either the __Mainstage__ or __Greenroom__ page. This Demo shows the role based access which is based upon the FaunaDB Superprofile, we have three Roles "Admin", "Speaker" and "Attendees".
- "Admin", "Speaker" : Able to access the Greenroom page, the page which opens up after "Join as a Speaker"
- "Attendee": Only able to view the Mainstage page, the page which opens up after "Join as a Attendee"

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61188295/189488258-b0e8535a-c7f6-4174-84d6-c3d93e92c484.mp4


### Demo of the Speaker Greenroom Page and the Mainstage page
Demo includes how an Admin starts the live stream and chats with the other Attendees on the Mainstage page, where the attendees are viewing the live broadcast.
The Greenroom page deploys an Jitsi call, which handles all the video and audio processing and transmission using RTMP which is later on broadcasted on the Mainstage Page, both the pages has an RocketChat Embedded Chat window to interact with each other during the event.

5. Exploring the huge codebase of Open Event Server to figure out how it works.

<div align="center">

## üîÆ Challenges in the future bag üîÆ
</div>

1. Improving the NextJS docker files.
2. Adding event email notification.
3. Improving the documentations.

## ‚ú®Mentors‚ú®
  
</div>

I am grateful to have got a chance to work under my two super knowledgeable and experienced mentors. They helped me throughout the whole GSoC season, and not only with technical development they also took care of developing my soft skills, which was certainly helpful.
Under their guidance, I sailed across the GSoC sea, and successfully learned many new things which include but are not limited to Docker, Software development flow, creating a better UX, docker networks, and best security practices.

The Astounding mentors:
1. Sing Li ([GitHub](https://github.com/Sing-Li), [Rocket.Chat](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/sing.li))
2. Marcos Defendi ([GitHub](https://github.com/MarcosSpessatto), [Rocket.Chat](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/marcos.defendi))
